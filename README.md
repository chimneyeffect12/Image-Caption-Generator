# Image-Caption-Generator
Image Caption Generator
This project presents an image caption generator using deep learning, combining a pre-trained VGG16 CNN for image feature extraction and an LSTM network for generating natural language descriptions. Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, it produces grammatically accurate captions. Evaluation using BLEU scores (BLEU-1: 0.5672) reflects strong object and action recognition. The model bridges vision and language, showcasing the effectiveness of CNN-LSTM architecture in image understanding and text generation.
